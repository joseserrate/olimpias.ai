Olimpias AI Landing Page
A high-credibility, conversion-oriented website that positions Olimpias AI as the center for Enterprise AI and AI system architecture in Bolivia and the region.

Problem

Bolivian enterprise and government leaders are:
	•	curious about AI but unclear what "serious AI" means beyond consumer tools
	•	skeptical of hype and pilots that don't translate into operational results
	•	missing a clear "capability layer" vendor that can design, govern, and deploy AI systems end-to-end

They need a trusted front door that:
	•	explains what Olimpias does in crisp, operational language
	•	signals legitimacy and rigor immediately
	•	converts interest into a call, intake, or pilot conversation

Target users
	•	CEOs and COOs of Bolivian and regional companies
	•	Heads of Ops, Finance, Compliance, Export, Supply Chain
	•	Government directors responsible for digital transformation, education, trade, productivity
	•	Potential partners and talent (engineers, operators, advisors)

Value

The landing page turns your messaging into:
	•	a clear positioning statement
	•	a standards-grade aesthetic (institutional)
	•	a lead capture machine for pilots and advisory engagements

Core Features

1) Positioning Hero

What it does
	•	Communicates Olimpias' core promise in 8 seconds.
	•	Anchors "Enterprise AI as infrastructure" with a strong visual identity.

Why it's important
	•	Most visitors decide credibility immediately.
	•	Sets you apart from "tool users" and "AI hype" providers.

How it works
	•	Above-the-fold: name, one-line doctrine, CTA.
	•	Supporting line: "Architecture + governance + performance."

Content requirements:
	•	Headline: "Enterprise AI Architecture for measurable performance."
	•	Subhead: "We design and govern AI systems that turn complexity into capability."

CTA requirements:
	•	Primary CTA: "Book a call"
	•	Secondary CTA: "See how it works" (scroll to methodology)

⸻

2) "What we do" as a System (not services list)

What it does
	•	Converts the abstract concept into a concrete operating model.

Why it's important
	•	You're selling capability, not deliverables.
	•	Leaders need to know what they are buying.

How it works
A 3-part framework section:
	1.	Design: workflows, roles, task decomposition, system shape
	2.	Govern: boundaries, autonomy, escalation, responsible adoption
	3.	Elevate: measurable performance, continuous improvement

Each part includes:
	•	1 sentence definition
	•	2 bullet examples
	•	one "output artifact" (what client gets)

⸻

3) Proof of seriousness (without bragging)

What it does
	•	Builds trust quickly with "signals of rigor."

Why it's important
	•	Bolivia is trust-sensitive: reputation precedes adoption.

How it works
	•	"Built on global-scale systems experience" (Apple Business Solutions experience phrased carefully)
	•	Education credentials (Finance + Digital Media + MSTC + Harvard Agentic Intensive)
	•	"How we work" commitments (3–5 short principles)
	•	measured outcomes
	•	disciplined architecture
	•	responsible governance

⸻

4) Use cases and outcomes (IA empresarial, not consumer AI)

What it does
	•	Shows applicability across enterprise operations and institutions.

Why it's important
	•	Leaders don't buy "AI." They buy outcomes.

How it works
A curated list of 6–9 use cases, grouped into "lanes," each with:
	•	target function
	•	typical inputs (documents, WhatsApp, PDFs, systems)
	•	outputs (decisions, workflows, automation, dashboards)
	•	what "success" looks like (measurable)

Example lanes:
	•	Trade/export operations
	•	Finance and revenue operations
	•	Compliance and risk
	•	Customer operations
	•	Internal productivity and workflow automation
	•	Government and education programs

⸻

5) Lead capture

What it does
	•	Converts interest into contact.

Why it's important
	•	The landing page is an instrument, not a brochure.

How it works
	•	CTA buttons: Book call, Request pilot intake
	•	Intake form (short, high signal)
	•	role, org, problem category
	•	what they want to improve
	•	timeframe (optional)
	•	contact

Optional:
	•	"Send a message on WhatsApp" link for Bolivia-first reality

⸻

6) SEO and credibility basics

What it does
	•	Makes the site discoverable and professional.

Why it's important
	•	This is a center. It must look official and be easy to verify.

How it works
	•	Metadata, OpenGraph, basic schema
	•	/about and /contact pages
	•	Clear legal footer and privacy policy
	•	Simple analytics

Logical Dependency Chain

Foundation first (needed for everything)
	1.	Design system: typography, spacing, color tokens, button styles
	2.	Landing page skeleton and routing (home/about/contact)
	3.	Core copy and content blocks
	4.	Hosting + domain + SSL

Fastest usable front end
	5.	Hero + CTA + scroll navigation
	6.	Framework section (Design/Govern/Elevate)
	7.	Use cases section
	8.	Contact form + thank you state
	9.	Analytics + basic SEO

Build the "center" layer
	10.	About page expansion + credibility signals
	11.	Capability brief (PDF) and distribution
	12.	Language toggle and content structure
	13.	Case studies and methodology pages

Risks and Mitigations

Technical risks
	•	Overbuilding too early (CMS, animations, heavy features)
	•	Mitigation: ship static MVP, keep content in repo, upgrade later
	•	Low-quality mobile experience
	•	Mitigation: design mobile-first, test on iPhone and mid-tier Android
	•	Form spam
	•	Mitigation: honeypot field, rate limit, basic CAPTCHA only if needed

MVP definition risk
	•	MVP becomes too "brochure"
	•	Mitigation: force the framework section to be operational, not descriptive
	•	make the CTA intake problem-driven, not generic "contact"

Resource constraints (solo builder)
	•	Too many pages and features
	•	Mitigation: single-page home + about/contact only, then expand
	•	Need visuals and credibility without "claims"
	•	Mitigation: focus on method, principles, and clear positioning, not logos and numbers

⸻

Appendix

Copy pillars (doctrine)
	•	Enterprise AI is infrastructure.
	•	Architecture first, governance always, performance measured.
	•	From tool use to systems that run.

Visual system notes
	•	Dark teal + white as primary brand
	•	Secondary neutral palette for typography and backgrounds
	•	Avoid AI sparkle/gradient tropes on the landing page itself
